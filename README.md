## Election-Audit Summary
Two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections is by decision law making and as well using this system for federal elections. For the first example this would be a great system to see if the people of the county would agree or disagree on any law making decision such as remodeling a local park, adding a new complex building to the area or even if students should wear uniforms to school or not, the list and opportunities can be endless and it will make the memebers of that community feel heard. The final example, is using this script for federal elections just have to change the county to state.
